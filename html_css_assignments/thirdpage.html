          >An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft
          that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or
          rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing
          configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes
          recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and
          research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four
          billion passengers annually on airliners[1] and transports more than
          200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which is less than
          1% of the world's cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a
          pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or
          computer-controlled such as drones.</b
