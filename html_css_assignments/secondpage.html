          Ganesha (Sanskrit: गणेश, IAST: Gaṇeśa), also known as Ganapati,
          Vinayaka, and Pillaiyar, is one of the best-known and most worshipped
          deities in the Hindu pantheon.[4] His image is found throughout
          India.[5] Hindu denominations worship him regardless of
          affiliations.[6] Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to
          Jains and Buddhists and also in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia
          (Java and Bali), Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Bangladesh and
          in countries with large ethnic Indian populations including Fiji,
          Guyana, Mauritius, and Trinidad and Tobago.
