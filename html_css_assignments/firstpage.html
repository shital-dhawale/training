          Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.<br />
          "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to
          life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part
          of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is
          often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
